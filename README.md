# Movies Sentiment Analysis Using NLP


In this project, we are going to implement a Natural Language Processing-based project. The project is Movies Reviews Sentiment Analysis which classifies the given review about the movie as a positive review or a negative review. So we train our model on the movie reviews dataset and use that model for implementing end-to-end applications.
